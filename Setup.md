Here’s the end-to-end build I’d use on two monitors to trade your $2–$8, fast-momentum playbook with advanced hotkeys. It’s opinionated, minimal, and tuned for speed + safety.

⸻

0) Golden rules (bake these in)
	•	Account: SIM while wiring; switch to live only after it’s smooth.
	•	TIF default: DAY+ (so your synthetic stops/entries work pre/post).
	•	Routes: prefer direct books you actually hit (NSDQ/ARCA/EDGX); avoid SMART during stress.
	•	Guardrails in scripts: spread cap, slip cap, timeout, strict abort below prior low, BE hop, max shares & notional.

⸻

1) Layout (two monitors)

Monitor A — “Find & Filter”
	•	Top-left: Trade Signal (Tight Momentum, refresh 10s).
	•	Below: Trade Signal (Loose Momentum, refresh 30s) + a 50-day RVOL spike scanner (refresh 60s).
	•	Right column: Watchlist window (from scanners), Breaking News window (linked to Montage color), Time & Sales (small).
	•	Status/Network tiny window visible (so you see latency/packet loss).

Monitor B — “Execute”
	•	Center: Montage (MainMont) + L2 (tall).
	•	Montage bound to color link used by scanners/news.
	•	Left: MainChart grid
	•	Row 1: 1-min (primary), 5-min (context).
	•	Row 2: Daily (left), 15-min (right).
	•	Right: Orders / Trades / Positions stacked.

Keep only one active symbol linked across Montage/L2/Charts; everything else is discovery.

⸻

2) Montage (fast, surgical)
	•	Columns shown: Bid/Ask, Size, Pos, AvgCost, PnL ($), Route, TIF, Shares, Price, StopPrice (if you like), Shortable (optional).
	•	Defaults:
	•	Route = ARCA (or your preferred direct ECN).
	•	TIF = DAY+.
	•	Price buttons: ±0.01 / ±0.05 / Bid / Ask.
	•	Double-click to price ON in montage price field (but NOT “double-click to send”).
	•	Confirmations: off for sends; on for route change (optional).
	•	Account selector: always visible; color it red in live to avoid SIM accidents.

⸻

3) Charts (clean, legible, actionable)
	•	1-min: VWAP (session), 9EMA, 20EMA, 200EMA; Volume with 20-SMA on volume; pre/post sessions ON; yesterday high/low lines; ATR(14) in $ (display as text).
	•	5-/15-min: same MAs + VWAP; lighter grid.
	•	Daily: 20/50/200 SMA for “where could it run?”.
	•	Hot areas drawn: Premarket H/L, Opening range H/L (first 5m), whole/half dollars.
	•	Link color: same as montage.

⸻

4) Indicators I actually keep
	•	Musts: VWAP, 9/20 EMA, ATR(14) in $ (target 0.10–0.15+ for your $2–$8 universe), Volume+SMA.
	•	Optional: Relative Volume label on chart (if your DAS build exposes it; otherwise keep RVOL in scanners only).

⸻

5) Advanced hotkeys / hot buttons (core set)

You already have these from our prior work; here’s how I’d map them:

Entries (left hand)
	•	Mouse Side Button 1 → ARM Breakout (Strict+Guardrails)
	•	Ctrl + Side Button 1 → ARM Pullback Join (prior-bar mid)

Management (right hand)
	•	Middle click (wheel) → Move Stop → BE (+0c/ +1c)
	•	Shift + Middle → Move Stop → Last Bar Low − 3c (ratchet only up)
	•	F → Flatten NOW (aggressive limit at Bid−5c)
	•	X → Cancel All (symbol)
	•	Esc → Emergency OUT (Market, full pos)

Optional bosses
	•	P → Partial 33% at 1R
	•	A → Add on half-pullback (buy limit at prior bar mid with same stop)
	•	S → Spike protect partial (auto 50% within N sec if +$0.30/ +15%)

Use your mouse software to map those mouse buttons to key combos that DAS listens for.

6) Scanners / Trade Signals (what to run)

Run 3–5 total to avoid CPU drag. Here’s a tight/loose pair and a 50-day volume scanner tailored to your rules.

A) Momentum — Tight (refresh 10s)
	•	Price: $2 to $8
	•	Change 1-min: ≥ +3%
	•	Float: 0.2M to 20M
	•	Min Today Vol: ≥ 200k (tune)
	•	1-min Vol spike: Vol(1m) ≥ 2 × SMA(1m Vol, 20)
	•	RVOL (session): ≥ 3 (if field available)
	•	ATR$ (14): ≥ 0.10
	•	Exclude: Halted, ETFs (by symbol filter list)

B) Momentum — Loose (refresh 30s)
	•	Price: $2 to $20
	•	Change 2-min: ≥ +5%
	•	Float: 0.2M to 20M
	•	1–2 min Vol spike: ≥ 1.5–2× avg
	•	RVOL: ≥ 2
	•	ATR$: ≥ 0.15

C) 50-day RVOL Spike (refresh 60s)
	•	Price: $2 to $20
	•	Today Vol: ≥ 5 × 50-day Avg Vol
	•	Gap up: ≥ 5% (optional)
	•	Float: 0.2M to 20M

D) ATR trigger table (optional, 60s)
	•	Price: $2 to $8
	•	ATR$ (14): 0.12–0.25 (sweet spot)
	•	RVOL: ≥ 2

Keep each scanner’s results window small, sorted by % Chg (1m) or Last update time, and link to the montage color so one click loads L2/charts.

⸻

7) Alerts (lightweight, high-value)
	•	Symbol alerts: HOD + $0.01, Premarket H + $0.01, LOD − $0.01 (one-click alert buttons, or set via chart).
	•	Volume surge: alert when 1-min Vol ≥ 3× its 20-SMA.
	•	Price halt proximity (manual): if tape goes from 2k prints/s to 0 and spread blows out, consider disarming; you can script a disarm hotkey (SetVar("PM_state","DONE"); CXL ALLSYMB;).

⸻

8) Risk controls that actually save you
	•	Daily stop (if broker supports DAS Risk Control) — set it. If not, keep a “Disable Trading” toolbar button visible for fast clicks.
	•	In scripts: cap shares and cap notional; refuse to arm if spread > 6–8c; cancel after 180s stale setups.
	•	First minute rule: for your $2–$8 names, skip the first 15–30 sec after the open unless it’s an A+ news+squeeze; spreads and halts kill edges.

⸻

9) Network / performance quick hits
	•	Hard-wire Ethernet, no VPN, QoS your PC, NTP clock sync.
	•	Network Setup: pick the lowest-latency Quote server (NY/NJ) and a different POP as backup; don’t let Auto flip mid-session.
	•	Reduce workload: only 1–2 L2 windows, 3–4 charts, and 3–5 scanners. Close extra T&S.

⸻

10) Morning flow (repeatable)
	1.	Network ping check (Setup→Network).
	2.	Open scanners; sort by 1-min change; build watchlist.
	3.	News glance for each candidate; mark catalysts (sec form, shelf, offering risk).
	4.	Load the best symbol → 1-min/5-min/daily → place ARM Breakout or ARM Join; confirm spread OK; TIF=DAY+.
	5.	Hands on: BE, ratchet, partial buttons ready.

⸻

Final word

You don’t need 40 windows. You need one clean symbol, two precise entry engines (Breakout + Join), a few bulletproof management buttons, and scanners that only surface what you actually trade. The rest is restraint.

If you want, I’ll export this into a named key map (suggested key bindings) and a parameter block you can paste once to keep all scripts consistent (spread/slip/age/ATR targets).
